My heart hides a cage
It hosts your breath
Behind bars of incense
In my blood your sugar burns
And paves my veins with salted wounds

Hey hey a high and low tide
Hey hey a high and low tide
From my ashes your light

On your skin
Heaven shivers in your tears
Close to me

Here I
Wait for you
To deliver me
Too soon to die again
There you
Breathe your days
You don't know
I'm the one

On your skin
Heaven shivers in your tears
Close to me

My soul
Lies with thorns and chains
Yielded and white
In your amber light
You're close to me
